# CS2343-Project2

## Overview of the Program
This project will use a myriad of classes (some derived from abstract classes) to perform functions involving calculating the day of the week of a particular calendar day as well as extracting information from a text file and performing multiple operations on that information. 

The primary function of the program will be to take in a four-character station ID and then find the following:
 1.	The index of that station within the provided Mesonet.txt file
 2.	Find two sets of stations whoâ€™s indices average out to the index of the given station
 3.	Find and use the ACSII values of the characters making up the station ID
 4.	Find other stations with the letter value of the avg. ACSII value of the given station ID
