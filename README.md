# CS2343-Project2

## Overview of the Program
This project will use a myriad of classes (some derived from abstract classes) to perform functions involving calculating the day of the week of a particular calendar day as well as extracting information from a text file and performing multiple operations on that information. 

The primary function of the program will be to take in a four-character station ID and then find the following:
 1.	The index of that station within the provided Mesonet.txt file
 2.	Find two sets of stations whoâ€™s indices average out to the index of the given station
 3.	Find and use the ACSII values of the characters making up the station ID
 4.	Find other stations with the letter value of the avg. ACSII value of the given station ID 

## DateTimeInherit Class
This class inherits from the *DateTimeAbstract* class which specifies the derived class must instantiate a *daysOfAnyMonth* method. This class will create a YearMonth object that, given a year and a month, will calculate the number of days within that month.This action is performed within the *daysOfAnyMonth* class. This information will then be passed to the *dayOfWeek* method which, using a LocalDate object, will be able to figure out the precise day of the week of a given date. That day will be passed back to the *daysOfAnyMonth* class which will use it to print the information in the project's specified format.

## PosAvg Class
This class uses three different class methods and a single constructor. The constructor takes a String a four characters which make up a station ID that will reside in the Mesonet.txt file provided. It will then store this String in a String class variable called **givenID**.

### Method: getStrArr()
This method will be used to read through the Mesonet.txt file and extract each of the station IDs within it. Each ID will be stored into an ArryList class variable called **okStations**. Once the file has been read through and all of the station IDs have been extracted, the method will return **okStations**.

### Method: indexOfStation()
This method will use the **okStations** class variable by looping through the ArrayList until it finds a string matching the class variable **givenID**. Once it finds this match, it will store the index value (plus one because the ArrayList is a 0 index list) into the class variable **idxOfGivenID**. It will then fill four other class variables with the two IDs that come before the **givenID** and the two IDs that come after it. The method will then return **idxOfGivenID**.

### Method: toString()
This *toString* method has been overridden to print off the four stations that were found to be surrounding the **givenID**. The method prints this information in the projects specified format where it details these stations as being the averages of the **givenID**.

## MesoInherit Class
This class inherits from the *MesoAbstract* class which dictates that it must instantiate a **calAverage()** method and a **letterAverage()** method. The *MesoInherit* class will make use of a single constructor and two member methods. The constructor will take in a MesoStation object which contains a station ID. It will use the class variable **station** to store a reference to this object. It will then extract the four characters of the station ID and put them into a four element character Array called **chars**.

### Method: calAverage()
This method will first use the **chars** member variable and convert each of the characters into its respective ASCII integer value. These values will bestored in their own int Array called **asciiArr**. The method will then sum up the elements of **asciiArr** and then divide the sum by four to find the average value of the ASCII values. Using the Math class' *floor* and *ceiling* methods, the average will be rounded up and down and each value will be stored in its respective variable. 

Another variable **theAvg** will be found by checking to see if the decimal value of the average is above or below 0.75. If it is above, **theAvg** will take the ceiling value and if not, it will take the floor value. The **theAvg** varaible will then be converted to its respective ASCII character value and stored in a class variable called **letterAvg**. The method will then return **ceiling**, **floor**, and **theAvg** values which are store in an integer array called **averages**.

### Method: letterAverage()
This method will simply return the class member variable **letterAvg** which was calclated in the *calAvg* method. 

## LetterAvg Class
This method will use a single constructor and contains two member methods. The constructor will take in a character which will be stored in the class member variable **avgLetter**. 

### Method: numberOfStationWithLetterAvg()
This method will need to look through the station IDs of the Mesonet.txt file provided, and thus, a PosAvg object called **arrayCollect** is created so that the *getStnArr* method of that class can be used. It will return an ArrayList of the Station IDs which will be stored in the class variable **okStationsArr**. The method will then loop through **okStationsArr** and find out which station IDs begin with the character stored in **avgLetter** and how many of them there are. The variable **numOfSimilarStations** will hold the integer value found while the String ArrayList **similarStations** will hold the IDs begining with **avgLetter**. The method will then return **numOfSimlarStations**.

### Method: toString()
This overridden *toString* method will use the create a StringBuilder object which will allow us to append each of the station IDs held within **similarStations** after the given text specified in the project's description. The StringBuilder object will then be stored in a String called **output** which will then be returned by the method.
